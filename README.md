# Testify

Testify is an ongoing sketch of what I think a test framework should be.
Design goals include:

* Test::Unit / Minitest syntax
* Generic test result data structure
* Pluggable output formatters
* Master/worker architecture
* Lazy reloading of master process as hard dependencies change

In essence, Testify aims to replace the (test framework + guard +
parallel hacks) set of libraries in an elegant way without monkeypatches
everywhere to make gems higher up the stack perform in a way they
weren't intended to.

Stay tuned.
